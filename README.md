# dotfiles

Finally got around to committing my dotfiles somewhere      
They used to be scattered around in multiple different [gists](https://gist.github.com/MahmoudDolah/6a5df2078ea059156bd1eaa1804f426c) and [github repos](https://github.com/MahmoudDolah/vimrc)

Refer to this [blog post](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/) for how everything is set up
